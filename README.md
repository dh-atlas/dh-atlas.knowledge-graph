The [**ATLAS Ontology**](https://dh-atlas.github.io/deliverables/ontology/index-en.html) has been implemented to describe the metadata of selected pilot projects and their related entities. This effort has resulted in a Knowledge Graph, which is currently available as a [compressed folder](knowledge_graph.zip) containing Turtle XML serializations. Additionally, some [demo files](/knowledge_graph_demo/) have been curated to illustrate the structure of the main entities within this model.
